# basePSfiles
Base codes used for to generate phyloseq objects used in other microbiome repositories at github.com/SuzanneFleishman. 


Adaptations of the dada2 pipeline and Phyloseq object creation pipelines in order to go from raw amplicon sequences (16s or ITS) to Phyloseq objects that are ready to be used in downstream analyses. Codes also filter out non-bacterial 16s sequences frequently present in plant material (e.g. chloroplasts and mictochondria).
